This so-called quarton coupler had so many potential applications in quantum operations and readout that it quickly became a focus of the lab.\\n\\nThis quarton coupler is a special type of superconducting circuit that has the potential to generate extremely strong nonlinear coupling, which is essential for running most quantum algorithms. As the researchers feed more current into the coupler, it creates an even stronger nonlinear interaction.

They measure this shift to determine the qubit’s state.\\n\\nNonlinear light-matter coupling between the qubit and resonator enables this measurement process.\\n\\nThe MIT researchers designed an architecture with a quarton coupler connected to two superconducting qubits on a chip.

This is another area they plan to explore with future work.\\n\\nFast operations and readout are especially important for quantum computers because qubits have finite lifespans, a concept known as coherence time.\\n\\nStronger nonlinear coupling enables a quantum processor to run faster and with lower error, so the qubits can perform more operations in the same amount of time. This means the qubits can run more rounds of error correction during their lifespans.\\n\\n“The more runs of error correction you can get in, the lower the error will be in the results,” Ye says.\\n\\nIn the long run, this work could help scientists build a fault-tolerant quantum computer, which is essential for practical, large-scale quantum computation.\\n\\nThis research was supported, in part, by the Army Research Office, the AWS Center for Quantum Computing, and the MIT Center for Quantum Engineering.\"}],\"role\":\"user\"}\n",

It amplifies the interaction between them, allowing for much faster and more complex operations. The more current pumped into the coupler, the stronger the nonlinear interaction becomes. Nonlinearity simply means the system behaves in a way that is greater than the sum of its parts, exhibiting more complex properties.\\n\\nFor quantum readout, the researchers shine microwave light onto a qubit. Depending on whether the qubit is in a state of \"0\" or \"1,\" the light\\'s frequency shifts slightly. This shift is measured to determine the qubit\\'s state. The stronger the connection between light and matter, the easier and faster it is to detect these tiny shifts.\\n\\nWhile this is just a fundamental physics demonstration, it\\'s a huge step towards building practical quantum computers. The team plans to refine the technology by adding components like filters to create a complete readout circuit. They also demonstrated a very strong matter-matter coupling, another important factor for quantum operations.\\n\\nWhy is speed so crucial? Because qubits are fragile. They have a limited lifespan, known as \"coherence time.\" The faster a quantum computer can operate, the more calculations it can perform within this limited time. And the more calculations, the more rounds of error correction, leading to more accurate results.\\n\\nIn the long run, this research could help scientists build a fault-tolerant quantum computer, the holy grail of quantum computing. A fault-tolerant machine would be reliable enough to tackle real-world problems, unlocking the full potential of this revolutionary technology.\\n'"

That future hinges on quantum computers, machines that harness the bizarre laws of quantum mechanics. But there\\\\\\'s a catch: these quantum computations need to happen incredibly fast, before errors creep in and ruin everything.\\\\n\\\\nThe secret to speed lies in how quickly we can read out the information stored in these quantum computers. This \"readout\" process relies on something called \"light-matter coupling,\" where light particles (photons) interact with artificial atoms, the building blocks of quantum information. The stronger this interaction, the faster the readout.\\\\n\\\\nNow, a team of researchers at MIT has achieved a breakthrough, creating the strongest light-matter coupling ever seen in a quantum system. Think of it like turning up the volume on a quantum conversation! They used a clever new design for a quantum circuit, boosting the coupling strength by a whopping tenfold compared to previous attempts. This could potentially make quantum computers run ten times faster!\\\\n\\\\nThis isn\\\\\\'t just about speed; it\\\\\\'s about making quantum computers practical. According to Yufeng “Bright” Ye, the lead author, this advancement could eliminate a major bottleneck in quantum computing. Faster readout means faster error correction, and that’s the key to building reliable, \"fault-tolerant\" quantum computers that can tackle real-world problems.\\\\n\\\\nThe team\\\\\\'s secret weapon is a \"quarton coupler,\" a special device that acts like a super-powered mediator between qubits (the quantum bits that store information). This coupler amplifies the interaction between light and matter, creating a much stronger signal. Think of it as a quantum megaphone!\\\\n\\\\nHow does it work? Imagine shining a tiny flashlight (microwave light) on a qubit. Depending on the qubit\\\\\\'s state (either a 0 or a 1), the light\\\\\\'s color (frequency) changes slightly. By measuring this change, researchers can \"read\" the qubit\\\\\\'s value. The stronger the light-matter coupling, the easier and faster it is to detect this change.\\\\n\\\\nWhile this is a major step forward, it\\\\\\'s not the finish line. The researchers still need to integrate this technology into a complete quantum computer. They\\\\\\'re already working on adding extra components to create a fast and efficient readout circuit.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, this research brings us closer to a future where quantum computers are not just theoretical marvels, but powerful tools capable of transforming science, technology, and beyond. Faster, more reliable quantum computers mean faster drug discovery, more efficient energy sources, and breakthroughs we can\\\\\\'t even imagine yet. This MIT breakthrough is a spark that could ignite the quantum revolution!\\\\n\\')], role=\\'model\\') grounding_metadata=None partial=None turn_complete=None error_code=None error_message=None interrupted=None custom_metadata=None usage_metadata=GenerateContentResponseUsageMetadata(cache_tokens_details=None, cached_content_token_count=None, candidates_token_count=551, candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: \\'TEXT\\'>, token_count=551)], prompt_token_count=1215, prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: \\'TEXT\\'>, token_count=1215)], thoughts_token_count=None, tool_use_prompt_token_count=None, tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None, total_token_count=1766, traffic_type=None) invocation_id=\\'e-990830bb-e3f4-4d20-9f48-57ef90b5e763\\' author=\\'news_assistant\\' actions=EventActions(skip_summarization=None, state_delta={}, artifact_delta={}, transfer_to_agent=None, escalate=None, requested_auth_configs={}) long_running_tool_ids=None branch=None id=\\'wrkYeqdu\\' timestamp=1749352827.2447\\n'"

Knowing the material’s superfluid stiffness will help scientists identify the mechanism of superconductivity in magic-angle graphene.</p><p>The team’s measurements suggest that magic-angle graphene’s superconductivity is primarily governed by quantum geometry, which refers to the conceptual “shape” of quantum states that can exist in a given material.</p><p>The results, which are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08494-7\" target=\"_blank\">reported today in the journal <em>Nature</em></a>, represent the first time scientists have directly measured superfluid stiffness in a two-dimensional material. To do so, the team developed a new experimental method which can now be used to make similar measurements of other two-dimensional superconducting materials.</p><p>“There’s a whole family of 2D superconductors that is waiting to be probed, and we are really just scratching the surface,” says study co-lead author Joel Wang, a research scientist in MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE).</p><p>The study’s co-authors from MIT’s main campus and MIT Lincoln Laboratory include co-lead author and former RLE postdoc Miuko Tanaka as well as Thao Dinh, Daniel Rodan-Legrain, Sameia Zaman, Max Hays, Bharath Kannan, Aziza Almanakly, David Kim, Bethany Niedzielski, Kyle Serniak, Mollie Schwartz, Jeffrey Grover, Terry Orlando, Simon Gustavsson, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, and William D. Oliver, along with Kenji Watanabe and Takashi Taniguchi of the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan.</p><p><strong>Magic resonance</strong></p><p>Since its first isolation and characterization in 2004, graphene has proven to be a wonder substance of sorts. The material is effectively a single, atom-thin sheet of graphite consisting of a precise, chicken-wire lattice of carbon atoms. This simple configuration can exhibit a host of superlative qualities in terms of graphene’s strength, durability, and ability to conduct electricity and heat.</p><p>In 2018, Jarillo-Herrero and colleagues discovered that when two graphene sheets are stacked on top of each other, at a precise “magic” angle, the twisted structure — now known as magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, or MATBG — exhibits entirely new properties, including superconductivity, in which electrons pair up, rather than repelling each other as they do in everyday materials. These so-called Cooper pairs can form a superfluid, with the potential to superconduct, meaning they could move through a material as an effortless, friction-free current.</p><p>“But even though Cooper pairs have no resistance, you have to apply some push, in the form of an electric field, to get the current to move,” Wang explains. “Superfluid stiffness refers to how easy it is to get these particles to move, in order to drive superconductivity.”</p><p>Today, scientists can measure superfluid stiffness in superconducting materials through methods that generally involve placing a material in a microwave resonator — a device which has a characteristic resonance frequency at which an electrical signal will oscillate, at microwave frequencies, much like a vibrating violin string. If a superconducting material is placed within a microwave resonator, it can change the device’s resonance frequency, and in particular, its “kinetic inductance,” by an amount that scientists can directly relate to the material’s superfluid stiffness.</p><p>However, to date, such approaches have only been compatible with large, thick material samples. The MIT team realized that to measure superfluid stiffness in atomically thin materials like MATBG would require a new approach.</p><p>“Compared to MATBG, the typical superconductor that is probed using resonators is 10 to 100 times thicker and larger in area,”&nbsp;Wang says. “We weren’t sure if such a tiny material would generate any measurable inductance at all.”</p><p><strong>A captured signal</strong></p><p>The challenge to measuring superfluid stiffness in MATBG has to do with attaching the supremely delicate material to the surface of the microwave resonator as seamlessly as possible.</p><p>“To make this work, you want to make an ideally lossless — i.e., superconducting — contact between the two materials,” Wang explains. “Otherwise, the microwave signal you send in will be degraded or even just bounce back instead of going into your target material.”</p><p>Will Oliver’s group at MIT has been developing techniques to precisely connect extremely delicate, two-dimensional materials, with the goal of building new types of quantum bits for future quantum-computing devices. For their new study, Tanaka, Wang, and their colleagues applied these techniques to seamlessly connect a tiny sample of MATBG to the end of an aluminum microwave resonator. To do so, the group first used conventional methods to assemble MATBG, then sandwiched the structure between two insulating layers of hexagonal boron nitride, to help maintain MATBG’s atomic structure and properties.</p><p>“Aluminum is a material we use regularly in our superconducting quantum computing research, for example, aluminum resonators to read out aluminum quantum bits (qubits),” Oliver explains. “So, we thought, why not make most of the resonator from aluminum, which is relatively straightforward for us, and then add a little MATBG to the end of it? It turned out to be a good idea.”</p><p>“To contact the MATBG, we etch it very sharply, like cutting through layers of a cake with a very sharp knife,” Wang says. “We expose a side of the freshly-cut MATBG, onto which we then deposit aluminum — the same material as the resonator — to make a good contact and form an aluminum lead.”</p><p>The researchers then connected the aluminum leads of the MATBG structure to the larger aluminum microwave resonator. They sent a microwave signal through the resonator and measured the resulting shift in its resonance frequency, from which they could infer the kinetic inductance of the MATBG.</p><p>When they converted the measured inductance to a value of superfluid stiffness, however, the researchers found that it was much larger than what conventional theories of superconductivity would have predicted. They had a hunch that the surplus had to do with MATBG’s quantum geometry —&nbsp;the way the quantum states of electrons correlate to one another.</p><p><strong>“</strong>We saw a tenfold increase in superfluid stiffness compared to conventional expectations, with a temperature dependence consistent with what the theory of quantum geometry predicts,” Tanaka says. “This was a ‘smoking gun’ that pointed to the role of quantum geometry in governing superfluid stiffness in this two-dimensional material.”</p><p>“This work represents a great example of how one can use sophisticated quantum technology currently used in quantum circuits to investigate condensed matter systems consisting of strongly interacting particles,” adds Jarillo-Herrero.</p><p>This research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Army Research Office, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. The work was carried out, in part, through the use of MIT.nano’s facilities.</p><p>A complementary study on magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG), conducted by a collaboration between Philip Kim’s group at Harvard University and Jarillo-Herrero’s group at MIT appears in the same issue of&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>.</p>'}],\n",
